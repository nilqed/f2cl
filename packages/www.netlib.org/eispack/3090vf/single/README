The files in this directory comprise a version of single-precision
EISPACK that has been tuned to take advantage of the cache, the vector
registers, and the vectorizing compiler of the ibm 3090-vf.  Some of
these files were not modified at all (from the original EISPACK versions),
but are included here for completeness.

The patches posted to the netlib mailing list have been
applied to the appropriate files.  See the file NETLIB_PATCHES.

For more details, see the paper by Cline and Meyering in the
directory, ../paper.
