1                    EXPLANATION OF COLUMN ENTRIES FOR THE SUMMARY STATISTICS

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 M   N  IP   SVD         MINFIT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 UNDER 'M' IS THE ROW DIMENSION OF EACH TEST MATRIX. 

 UNDER 'N' IS THE COLUMN DIMENSION OF THE MATRIX.

 UNDER 'IP' IS THE COLUMN DIMENSION OF THE CONSTANT MATRIX.  (AS PRESENTLY CONSTITUTED,      
 THE IDENTITY MATRIX IS GENERATED AS THE CONSTANT MATRIX.)

 UNDER 'SVD' ARE TWO NUMBERS.  THE FIRST NUMBER, AN INTEGER, IS THE ERROR FLAG RETURNED      
 FROM  SVD.  THE SECOND NUMBER IS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE BASED UPON A RESIDUAL.          

 UNDER 'MINFIT' ARE TWO NUMBERS.  THE FIRST NUMBER, AN INTEGER, IS THE ERROR FLAG RETURNED   
 FROM  MINFIT.  THE SECOND NUMBER IS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE BASED UPON A RESIDUAL.       

 -1.0  AS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE IS PRINTED IF AN ERROR IN THE CORRESPONDING PATH HAS
 PREVENTED THE COMPUTATION OF THE SINGULAR VALUES.

1       TABULATION OF THE ERROR FLAG  ERROR  AND THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE FOR
     THE  EISPACK  CODES.  THIS RUN DISPLAYS THESE STATISTICS FOR REAL LINEAR SYSTEMS.
