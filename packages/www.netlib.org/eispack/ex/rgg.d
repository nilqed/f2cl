1                    EXPLANATION OF COLUMN ENTRIES FOR THE SUMMARY STATISTICS

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ORDER  QZIT(T)  QZIT(F)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 UNDER 'ORDER' IS THE ORDER OF EACH TEST MATRIX SYSTEM.

 UNDER 'QZIT(T)  QZIT(F)' ARE TWO NUMBERS AND A KEYWORD.  THE FIRST NUMBER, AN INTEGER, IS THE 
 ERROR FLAG RETURNED FROM  QZIT.  THE SECOND NUMBER IS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE BASED UPON   
 THE RESIDUAL COMPUTED FOR THE  QZIT(T) (BOTH EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS) PATH.  THE KEYWORD 
 REPORTS THE DUPLICATION OF COMPUTED EIGENVALUES FROM THE  QZIT(T)  AND  QZIT(F) (EIGENVALUES  
 ONLY) PATHS.  'SAME' MEANS THAT THE EIGENVALUES ARE EXACT DUPLICATES.  'DIFF' MEANS THAT FOR  
 AT LEAST ONE PAIR OF CORRESPONDING EIGENVALUES, THE MEMBERS OF THE PAIR ARE NOT IDENTICAL.    
0-1.0  AS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE IS PRINTED IF AN ERROR IN THE PATH HAS      
 PREVENTED THE COMPUTATION OF THE EIGENVALUES AND VECTORS.

 THE  QZIT(T)  PATH USES THE EISPACK CODES  QZHES-QZIT-QZVAL-QZVEC, 
 AS CALLED FROM DRIVER SUBROUTINE  RGG.
 THE  QZIT(F)  PATH USES THE EISPACK CODES  QZHES-QZIT-QZVAL,
 AS CALLED FROM DRIVER SUBROUTINE  RGG.
