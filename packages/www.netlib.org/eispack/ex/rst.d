 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 UNDER 'ORDER' IS THE ORDER OF EACH TEST MATRIX.

 UNDER 'TQL2   TQL1' ARE THREE NUMBERS.  THE FIRST NUMBER, AN INTEGER, IS THE ABSOLUTE SUM OF  
 THE ERROR FLAGS RETURNED SEPARATELY FROM  TQL2  AND  TQL1.  THE SECOND NUMBER IS THE MEASURE  
 OF PERFORMANCE BASED UPON THE RESIDUAL COMPUTED FOR THE  TQL2  PATH.  THE THIRD NUMBER
 MEASURES THE AGREEMENT OF THE EIGENVALUES FROM THE  TQL2  AND  TQL1  PATHS.

 UNDER 'IMTQL2 IMTQL1' ARE THREE NUMBERS WITH MEANING LIKE THOSE UNDER  'TQL2   TQL1'.         

 UNDER 'LB' AND 'UB' ARE THE INPUT VARIABLES SPECIFYING THE INTERVAL TO  BISECT  AND  TSTURM.  

 UNDER 'M' IS THE NUMBER OF EIGENVALUES DETERMINED BY  BISECT  AND  TSTURM  THAT LIE IN THE
 INTERVAL (LB,UB).

 UNDER EACH OF 'IMTQLV', 'TSTURM', 'BISECT', AND 'RATQR' ARE TWO NUMBERS.  THE FIRST NUMBER,   
 AN INTEGER, IS THE ABSOLUTE SUM OF THE ERROR FLAGS RETURNED FROM THE RESPECTIVE PATH.         
 THE SECOND NUMBER IS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE BASED UPON THE RESIDUAL COMPUTED FOR THE PATH.

 UNDER 'M1' AND 'NO' ARE THE VARIABLES SPECIFYING THE LOWER BOUNDARY INDEX AND THE NUMBER      
 OF EIGENVALUES TO  RATQR.  

 -1.0  AS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE IS PRINTED IF AN ERROR IN THE CORRESPONDING PATH HAS
 PREVENTED THE COMPUTATION OF THE EIGENVECTORS.

 THE  TQL2    PATH USES THE EISPACK CODES  TQL2  .            
 THE  TQL1    PATH USES THE EISPACK CODES  TQL1  .            
 THE  IMTQL2  PATH USES THE EISPACK CODES  IMTQL2,            
 AS CALLED FROM DRIVER SUBROUTINE  RST.
 THE  IMTQL1  PATH USES THE EISPACK CODES  IMTQL1,            
 AS CALLED FROM DRIVER SUBROUTINE  RST.
 THE  IMTQLV  PATH USES THE EISPACK CODES  IMTQLV-TINVIT.
 THE  TSTURM  PATH USES THE EISPACK CODES  TSTURM.
 THE  BISECT  PATH USES THE EISPACK CODES  BISECT-TINVIT.
 THE  RATQR   PATH USES THE EISPACK CODES  RATQR -TINVIT.
