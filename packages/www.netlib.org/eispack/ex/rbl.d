1                    EXPLANATION OF COLUMN ENTRIES FOR THE SUMMARY STATISTICS

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ORDER B.W. IP   BANDV
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 UNDER 'ORDER' IS THE ORDER OF EACH TEST MATRIX. 

 UNDER 'B.W.' IS THE FULL BAND WIDTH OF THE MATRIX. 

 UNDER 'IP' IS THE COLUMN DIMENSION OF THE CONSTANT MATRIX.

 UNDER 'BANDV' ARE TWO NUMBERS.  THE FIRST NUMBER, AN INTEGER, IS THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE
 ERROR FLAG RETURNED FROM  BANDV.  THE SECOND NUMBER IS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE BASED    
 UPON THE RESIDUAL COMPUTED FROM THE SOLUTION.
