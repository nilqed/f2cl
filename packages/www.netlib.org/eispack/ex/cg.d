 'BALANCING' IS THE OPTION THAT EMPLOYS SUBROUTINE  CBAL  TO  BALANCE THE MATRIX BEFORE THE    
 EIGENVALUES ARE COMPUTED AND  CBABK2  TO BACK TRANSFORM THE EIGENVECTORS.                     

 'VECTORS COMPUTED' IDENTIFIES BY POSITION, IN THE SET RETURNED BY  COM-R, THOSE EIGENVALUES   
 FOR WHICH  CINVIT  COMPUTED THE ASSOCIATED EIGENVECTORS.  T  INDEXES AN EIGENVALUE FOR WHICH  
 THE EIGENVECTOR WAS COMPUTED AND  F  INDEXES A PASSED EIGENVALUE.

 UNDER 'ORDER' IS THE ORDER OF EACH TEST MATRIX.   

 UNDER 'LOW' AND 'UPP' ARE INTEGERS INDICATING THE BOUNDARY INDICES FOR THE BALANCED MATRIX.   

 UNDER 'T' IS THE LETTER L OR Q INDICATING THE USE OF ELEMENTARY OR UNITARY TRANSFORMATIONS.   

 PERFORMANCE REPORTED UNDER 'COM-R2 COM-R' IS THAT OF  COMLR2  AND  COMLR  ON LINE HEADED BY
 'L' AND THAT OF  COMQR2  AND  COMQR  ON LINE HEADED BY 'Q'.

 UNDER 'COM-R2 COM-R' ARE TWO NUMBERS AND A KEYWORD.  THE FIRST NUMBER, AN INTEGER, IS THE     
 ABSOLUTE SUM OF THE ERROR FLAGS RETURNED SEPARATELY FROM  COM-R2  AND  COM-R.  THE SECOND     
 NUMBER IS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE BASED UPON THE RESIDUAL COMPUTED FOR THE  COM-R2  PATH.  
 THE KEYWORD REPORTS THE DUPLICATION OF THE COMPUTED EIGENVALUES FROM  COM-R2  AND  COM-R.     
 'SAME' MEANS THAT THE EIGENVALUES ARE EXACT DUPLICATES.  'DIFF' MEANS THAT FOR AT LEAST ONE   
 PAIR OF CORRESPONDING EIGENVALUES, THE MEMBERS OF THE PAIR ARE NOT IDENTICAL.                 

 UNDER 'CINVIT' ARE TWO NUMBERS.  THE FIRST NUMBER, AN INTEGER, IS THE ABSOLUTE SUM OF THE     
 ERROR FLAGS RETURNED FROM THE PATH.  THE SECOND NUMBER IS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE BASED
 UPON THE RESIDUAL COMPUTED FOR THE PATH.

 -1.0  AS THE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE IS PRINTED IF AN ERROR IN THE CORRESPONDING PATH HAS
 PREVENTED THE COMPUTATION OF THE EIGENVECTORS.
